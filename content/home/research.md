## Research

My main research interests lie in the analysis of partial differential equation.  
In particular, are focused on problems related to fluid dynamics.

Most of my papers are available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/a/0000-0002-6254-2070.html).

You can find my PhD thesis [here](https://iris.gssi.it/handle/20.500.12571/15111#.YAM8auj7RPY).
