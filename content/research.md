## Research

My research interests are focused on problems related to fluid dynamics,
for both compressible and incompressible fluids.\
I am currently working on stability problems such as inviscid damping
and enhanced dissipation.

You can find my PhD thesis [here](https://iris.gssi.it/handle/20.500.12571/15111#.YAM8auj7RPY), with title "*Linear stability analysis of stationary Euler flows for passive scalars and inhomogeneous fluids*". 

Here is a list of my papers:
